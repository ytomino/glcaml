(** Interface to SDL framebuffer

  SDL presents a very simple interface to the display framebuffer. The framebuffer is represented as an
  offscreen surface to which you can write directly. If you want the screen to show what you have written,
  call the update function which will guarantee that the desired portion of the screen is updated.

  Before you call any of the SDL video functions, you must first call [init \[VIDEO\]],
  which initializes the video and events in the SDL library. Check for the exception [SDL_failure],
  to see if there were any errors in starting up.

  If you use both sound and video in your application, you need to call  [init \[AUDIO; VIDEO\]]
  before opening the sound device, otherwise under Win32 DirectX, you won't be able to set full-screen display modes.

  After you have initialized the library, you can start up the video display in a number of ways.
  The easiest way is to pick a common screen resolution and depth and just initialize the video, checking for errors.
  You will probably get what you want, but SDL may be emulating your requested mode and converting the display
  on update. The best way is to query, for the best video mode closest to the desired one, and then convert
  your images to that pixel format.

  SDL currently supports any bit depth >= 8 bits per pixel. 8 bpp formats are considered 8-bit palettized modes,
  while 12, 15, 16, 24, and 32 bits per pixel are considered "packed pixel" modes, meaning each pixel contains the
  RGB color components packed in the bits of the pixel.

  After you have initialized your video mode, you can take the surface that was returned, and write to it
  like any other framebuffer, calling the update routine as you go.

  When you have finished your video access and are ready to quit your application, you should call [quit ()] to
  shutdown the video and events. *)

  (** [True] if the surface passed in should be locked, else [false] *)
  val must_lock : surface -> bool

  (** [lock_surface ()] sets up a surface for directly accessing the pixels. Between calls to [lock_surface ()]
    and [unlock_surface ()], you can write to and read from [(surface_pixels _)], using the pixel format stored in
    [(surface_format _)]. Once you are done accessing the surface, you should use [unlock_surface ()] to release it.
    Not all surfaces require locking. If [(must_lock surface)] is [false], then you can read and write
    to the surface at any time, and the pixel format of the surface will not change.
    No operating system or library calls should be made between [lock/unlock] pairs, as critical system locks
    may be held during this time.
    It should be noted, that since SDL 1.1.8 surface locks are recursive. This means that you can lock a
    surface multiple times, but each lock must have a match unlock. *)

  (** [video_mode_ok width height bpp_flags -> true/false]
    [video_mode_ok] returns false if the requested mode is not supported under any bit depth,
      or returns true if a closest available mode with the given width, height and
      requested surface flags exists (see [set_video_mode]).
    You can usually request any bpp you want when setting the video mode and SDL will emulate that
    color depth with a shadow video surface.
    The arguments to [video_mode_ok] are the same ones you would pass to [set_video_mode]*)
  val video_mode_ok : int -> int -> int -> video_flag list -> bool

  (** [set_video_mode width height bpp flags -> surface]
    Set up a video mode with the specified width, height and bitsperpixel.
    If bpp is 0, it is treated as the current display bits per pixel.
    The flags parameter is the same as the flags field of the SDL surface structure.
    A list containing one or more of the following values are valid.
    - [SWSURFACE] Create the video surface in system memory
    - [HWSURFACE] Create the video surface in video memory
    - [ASYNCBLIT] Enables the use of asynchronous updates of the display surface. This will usually slow down blitting on single CPU machines, but may provide a speed increase on SMP systems.
    - [ANYFORMAT] Normally, if a video surface of the requested bits-per-pixel (bpp) is not available, SDL will emulate one with a shadow surface. Passing [ANYFORMAT] prevents this and causes SDL to use the video surface, regardless of its pixel depth.
    - [HWPALETTE] Give SDL exclusive palette access. Without this flag you may not always get the the colors you request with SDL_SetColors or SDL_SetPalette.
    - [DOUBLEBUF] Enable hardware double buffering; only valid with [HWSURFACE]. Calling [flip] will flip the buffers and update the screen. All drawing will take place on the surface that is not displayed at the moment. If double buffering could not be enabled then [flip] will just perform a [update_rect] on the entire screen.
    - [FULLSCREEN] SDL will attempt to use a fullscreen mode. If a hardware resolution change is not possible (for whatever reason), the next higher resolution will be used and the display window centered on a black background.
    - [OPENGL] Create an OpenGL rendering context. You should have previously set OpenGL video attributes with [set_attribute].
    - [OPENGLBLIT] Create an OpenGL rendering context, like above, but allow normal blitting operations. The screen (2D) surface may have an alpha channel, and [update_rects] must be used for updating changes to the screen surface.
    - [RESIZABLE] Create a resizable window. When the window is resized by the user a [VIDEORESIZE] event is generated and [set_video_mode] can be called again with the new size.
    - [NOFRAME] If possible, [NOFRAME] causes SDL to create a window with no title bar or frame decoration. Fullscreen modes automatically have this flag set.
    Note: Whatever flags [set_video_mode] could satisfy are set in the flags member of the returned surface.
    Note: The bpp parameter is the number of bits per pixel, so a bpp of 24 uses the packed representation of 3 bytes/pixel. For the more common 4 bytes/pixel mode, use a bpp of 32. Somewhat oddly, both 15 and 16 will request a 2 bytes/pixel mode, but different pixel formats.
    Note: Use [SWSURFACE] if you plan on doing per-pixel manipulations, or blit surfaces with alpha channels, and require a high framerate.
    When you use hardware surfaces ([HWSURFACE]), SDL copies the surfaces from video memory to system memory when you lock them, and back when you unlock them.
    This can cause a major performance hit. (Be aware that you may request a hardware surface, but receive a software surface.
    Many platforms can only provide a hardware surface when using [FULLSCREEN].) [HWSURFACE] is best used when the surfaces you'll be blitting can also be stored in video memory.
    Note: If you want to control the position on the screen when creating a windowed surface, you may do so by setting the environment variables "SDL_VIDEO_CENTERED=center" or "SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS=x,y". You can set them via [putenv].
    The framebuffer surface; if it fails it raises SDL_failure. The surface returned is freed by [quit]  and should not be freed by the caller. Note: This rule includes consecutive calls to [set_video_mode] (i.e. resize or rez change) - the pre-existing surface will be released automatically.  *)
  val set_video_mode : int -> int -> int -> video_flag list -> surface

  (** [create_rgb_surface video_flag_list width height bitsperpixel -> surface]
    Allocate an empty surface (must be called after [set_video_mode])
    If bitsPerPixel is 8 an empty palette is allocated for the surface, otherwise a 'packed-pixel' pixel format is created using internal RGBA masks based on standard 15,16,24 and 32 bitperpixel formats, and taking platform endianness into account.
    The flags specifies the type of surface that should be created, it is alist containing one or more of the following possible values.
    - [SWSURFACE ]     SDL will create the surface in system memory. This improves the performance of pixel level access, however you may not be able to take advantage of some types of hardware blitting.
    - [HWSURFACE]      SDL will attempt to create the surface in video memory. This will allow SDL to take advantage of Video->Video blits (which are often accelerated).
    - [SRCCOLORKEY]      This flag turns on color keying for blits from this surface. If [HWSURFACE] is also specified and color keyed blits are hardware-accelerated, then SDL will attempt to place the surface in video memory. If the screen is a hardware surface and color keyed blits are hardware-accelerated then the [HWSURFACE] flag will be set. Use [set_color_key] to set or clear this flag after surface creation.
    - [SRCALPHA]     This flag turns on alpha-blending for blits from this surface. If [HWSURFACE] is also specified and alpha-blending blits are hardware-accelerated, then the surface will be placed in video memory if possible. If the screen is a hardware surface and alpha-blending blits are hardware-accelerated then the [HWSURFACE] flag will be set. Use [set_alpha] to set or clear this flag after surface creation. *)
  val create_rgb_surface :
    video_flag list -> int -> int -> int -> surface

  (** [load_bmp file -> surface]
    Loads a surface from a named Windows BMP file.
    Note: When loading a 24-bit Windows BMP file, pixel data points are loaded as blue, green, red, and NOT red, green, blue (as one might expect). *)
  val load_bmp : string -> surface

  (** [save_bmp surface file ]
    Saves the SDL_Surface {i surface} as a Windows BMP file named {i file} *)
  val save_bmp : surface -> string -> unit

  (** [set_color_key surf flag key]
    Sets the color key (transparent pixel) in a blittable surface and enables or disables RLE blit acceleration.
    RLE acceleration can substantially speed up blitting of images with large horizontal runs of transparent pixels
    (i.e., pixels that match the key value). The key must be of the same pixel format as the surface, [map_rgb]
    is often useful for obtaining an acceptable value.
    If flag is [SRCCOLORKEY] then key is the transparent pixel value in the source image of a blit.
    If flag contains  [RLEACCEL] then the surface will be draw using RLE acceleration when drawn with blit_surface.
    The surface will actually be encoded for RLE acceleration the first time [blit_surface] or [display_format]
    is called on the surface. *)
  val set_color_key : surface -> video_flag list -> int32 -> unit

  (** [set_alpha surf flag alpha]
    Note: This function and the semantics of SDL alpha blending have changed since version 1.1.4. Up until version 1.1.5,
    an alpha value of 0 was considered opaque and a value of 255 was considered transparent.
    This has now been inverted: 0 ([ALPHA_TRANSPARENT]) is now considered transparent and 255 (S[ALPHA_OPAQUE]) is now
    considered opaque.

    [set_alpha] is used for setting the per-surface alpha value and/or enabling and disabling alpha blending.

    The surface parameter specifies which surface whose alpha attributes you wish to adjust. flags is used to specify
    whether alpha blending should be used (S[SRCALPHA]) and whether the surface should use RLE acceleration for blitting
    ([RLEACCEL]). flags can contain both of these two options, one of these options or none.
    If [SRCALPHA] is not passed as a flag then all alpha information is ignored when blitting the surface.
    The alpha parameter is the per-surface alpha value; a surface need not have an alpha channel to use per-surface
    alpha and blitting can still be accelerated with [RLEACCEL.]

    Note: The per-surface alpha value of 128 is considered a special case and is optimised, so it's much faster than other
    per-surface values.

    Alpha affects surface blitting in the following ways:
    - RGBA->RGB with [SRCALPHA]     The source is alpha-blended with the destination, using the alpha channel. [SRCCOLORKEY] and the per-surface alpha are ignored.
    - RGBA->RGB without [SRCALPHA]    The RGB data is copied from the source. The source alpha channel and the per-surface alpha value are ignored. If [SRCCOLORKEY] is set, only the pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied.
    - RGB->RGBA with [SRCALPHA]     The source is alpha-blended with the destination using the per-surface alpha value. If [SRCCOLORKEY] is set, only the pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied. The alpha channel of the copied pixels is set to opaque.
    - RGB->RGBA without [SRCALPHA]    The RGB data is copied from the source and the alpha value of the copied pixels is set to opaque. If [SRCCOLORKEY] is set, only the pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied.
    - RGBA->RGBA with [SRCALPHA]    The source is alpha-blended with the destination using the source alpha channel. The alpha channel in the destination surface is left untouched. [SRCCOLORKEY] is ignored.
    - RGBA->RGBA without [SRCALPHA]   The RGBA data is copied to the destination surface. If [SRCCOLORKEY] is set, only the pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied.
    - RGB->RGB with [SRCALPHA]      The source is alpha-blended with the destination using the per-surface alpha value. If [SRCCOLORKEY] is set, only the pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied.
    - RGB->RGB without [SRCALPHA]     The RGB data is copied from the source. If [SRCCOLORKEY] is set, only the pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied.
    Note: When blitting, the presence or absence of [SRCALPHA] is relevant only on the source surface, not the destination.
    Note: Note that RGBA->RGBA blits (with [SRCALPHA] set) keep the alpha of the destination surface.
    This means that you cannot compose two arbitrary RGBA surfaces this way and get the result
    you would expect from "overlaying" them; the destination alpha will work as a mask.
    Note: Also note that per-pixel and per-surface alpha cannot be combined; the per-pixel alpha is always used if available. *)
  val set_alpha : surface -> video_flag list -> int -> unit

  (** [set_clipping surf top left bottom right]
    Sets the clipping rectangle for a surface. When this surface is the destination of a blit, only the area within the clip rectangle will be drawn into.
    The rectangle pointed to by the coordinates (top left  bottom right) will be clipped to the edges of the surface so that the clip rectangle for a surface can never fall outside the edges of the surface. *)
  val set_clipping : surface -> int -> int -> int -> int -> unit

  (** [disable_clipping surface]
    Disables clipping to the clipping rectangle set for a surface *)
  val disable_clipping : surface -> unit

  (** [display_format src_surface -> dest_surface]
    This function takes a surface and copies it to a new surface of the pixel format and colors of the video framebuffer, suitable for fast blitting onto the display surface. It calls [convert_surface].
    If you want to take advantage of hardware colorkey or alpha blit acceleration, you should set the colorkey and alpha value before calling this function.
    If you want an alpha channel, see [display_format_alpha]. *)
  val display_format : surface -> surface

  (** [get_rgb surface -> pixel -> red * green * blue]
    Get RGB component values from a pixel stored in the specified pixel format. This function uses the entire 8-bit \[0..255\] range when
    converting color components from pixel formats with less than 8-bits per RGB component (e.g., a completely white pixel in 16-bit RGB565 format would return \[0xff, 0xff, 0xff\] not \[0xf8, 0xfc, 0xf8\]). *)
  val get_rgb : surface -> int32 -> int * int * int

  (** [get_rgba  surface -> pixel -> red * green * blue * alpha]
    Get RGBA component values from a pixel stored in the specified pixel format.
    This function uses the entire 8-bit \[0..255\] range when converting color components from pixel formats with less than 8-bits per RGB component
    (e.g., a completely white pixel in 16-bit RGB565 format would return \[0xff, 0xff, 0xff\] not \[0xf8, 0xfc, 0xf8\]).
    If the surface has no alpha component, the alpha will be returned as 0xff (100% opaque).     *)
  val get_rgba : surface -> int32 -> int * int * int * int

  (** [map_rgb surface -> red -> green -> blue -> pixel]
    Maps the RGB color value to the specified pixel format and returns the pixel value as a 32-bit int.
    If the format has a palette (8-bit) the index of the closest matching color in the palette will be returned.
    If the specified pixel format has an alpha component it will be returned as all 1 bits (fully opaque). *)
  val map_rgb : surface -> int -> int -> int -> int32

  (** [map_rgba surface -> red -> green -> blue -> alpha -> pixel]
    Maps the RGBA color value to the specified pixel format and returns the pixel value as a 32-bit int.
    If the format has a palette (8-bit) the index of the closest matching color in the palette will be returned.
    If the specified pixel format has an alpha component it will be returned as all 1 bits (fully opaque). *)
  val map_rgba : surface -> int -> int -> int -> int -> int32

  (** Rectangle type, used for clipping and blitting operations *)
  type rect = {
    mutable rect_x : int;   (** top left *)
    mutable rect_y : int;   (** top *)
    mutable rect_w : int;   (** width *)
    mutable rect_h : int    (** height *)
  }

  (** [fill_surface surface  pixel]
    Fills the surface with pixels of the given color *)
  val fill_surface : surface -> int32 -> unit

  (** [fill_rect surface  dstrect pixel]
    This function performs a fast fill of the given rectangle with color.
    The color should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be generated by the [map_rgb] or [map_rgba] functions.
    If the color value contains an alpha value then the destination is simply "filled" with that alpha information, no blending takes place.
    If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via [set_clip_rect]), then this function will clip based on the intersection of the clip rectangle
    and the dstrect rectangle, and the dstrect rectangle will be modified to represent the area actually filled.
    If you call this on the video surface (ie: the value of [get_video_surface ()]) you may have to update the video surface to see the result.
    This can happen if you are using a shadowed surface that is not double buffered in Windows XP using build 1.2.9. *)
  val fill_rect : surface -> rect -> int32 -> unit

  (** [update_surface surface]
    Makes sure the screen is updated *)
  val update_surface : surface -> unit

  (** [update_rect surface left top width height]
    Makes sure the given area is updated on the given screen. The rectangle must be confined within the screen boundaries
    (no clipping is done).
    This function should not be called while 'screen' is locked (lock_surface). *)
  val update_rect : surface -> int -> int -> int -> int -> unit

  (** [update_rects surface  rect_array]
    Makes sure the given list of rectangles is updated on the given screen. The rectangles must all be confined within
    the screen boundaries (no clipping is done).
    WARNING : passing rectangles not confined within the screen boundaries to this function can cause very nasty
    crashes, at least with SDL 1.2.8, at least in Windows and Linux.
    This function should not be called while screen is locked.
    Note: It is advised to call this function only once per frame, since each call has some processing overhead.
    This is no restriction since you can pass any number of rectangles each time.
    The rectangles are not automatically merged or checked for overlap. In general, the programmer can use his or her
    knowledge about his or her particular rectangles to merge them in an efficient way, to avoid overdraw. *)
  val update_rects : surface ->  rect array -> unit

  (** [flip surface]
    On hardware that supports double-buffering, this function sets up a flip and returns. The hardware will wait for vertical retrace,
    and then swap video buffers before the next video surface blit or lock will return. On hardware that doesn't support double-buffering,
    this is equivalent to calling [(update_surface screen)]
    The [DOUBLEBUF] flag must have been passed to [set_video_mode], when setting the video mode for this function to perform hardware flipping. *)
  val flip : surface -> unit

  (** [blit_surface source_surface srcrect dest_surface dstrect]
    This performs a fast blit from the source surface to the destination surface.
    The width and height in srcrect determine the size of the copied rectangle. Only the position is used in the dstrect (the width and height are ignored).
    If srcrect is [None], the entire surface is copied. If dstrect is [None], then the destination position (upper left corner) is (0, 0).
    The final blit rectangle is saved in dstrect after all clipping is performed (srcrect is not modified).
    The blit function should not be called on a locked surface. I.e. when you use your own drawing functions you may need to lock a surface,
    but this is not the case with blit_surface. Like most surface manipulation functions in SDL, it should not be used together with OpenGL.
    The results of blitting operations vary greatly depending on whether [SRCAPLHA] is set or not. See [set_alpha] for an explanation of how this affects your results.
    Colorkeying and alpha attributes also interact with surface blitting.. *)
  val blit_surface : surface -> rect option -> surface -> rect option -> unit

  (** Color type *)
  type color = {
    red : int;     (** 0..255 *)

  }

  (** [set_colors surf colors firstcolor ncolors]
    Sets a portion of the colormap for the given 8-bit surface.

    When surface is the surface associated with the current display, the display colormap will be updated with the requested colors.
    If [HWPALETTE] was set in set_video_mode flags, set_colors will always return true, and the palette is guaranteed to be set the way you desire,
    even if the window colormap has to be warped or run under emulation.

    The color components of a [color] structure are 8-bits in size, giving you a total of 2563 = 16777216 colors.

    Palettized (8-bit) screen surfaces with the [HWPALETTE] flag have two palettes, a logical palette that is used for mapping blits to/from the surface and a
    physical palette (that determines how the hardware will map the colors to the display).
    [set_colors] modifies both palettes (if present), and is equivalent to calling [set_palette] with the flags set to [\[LOGPAL ; PHYSPAL\]]. *)

(*---------------------------------------------------- Events ---------------------------------------------- *)

(** Event handling allows the application to receive input from the user.
  Event handling is initalised (along with video) with a call to [init \[VIDEO\]]
  Internally, SDL stores all the events waiting to be handled in an event queue. Using functions like [poll_event],
  [peep_events] and [wait_event] you can observe and handle waiting input events.
  The key to event handling in SDL is the [event] type. The event queue itself is composed of a series of [events],
  one for each waiting event. [events] are read from the queue with the [poll_event] function and it is then up to
  the application to process the information stored with them.

    Also, remember that the position of the letters can vary and so, although all of them are available on most keyboards, their position might not be practical for your application.

  (** [make_mipmaps surface_bitmap scale_filter_type  ->  array of mipmaps down to 1x1]
    Makes mipmaps suitable for use in OpenGL, by generating an array of mipmaps down to 1x1.
    The side of each mipmap is a power of two; if the sides of the original surface are powers of two then that
    surface will be used as the first mipmap in the array, otherwise it will be scaled to the nearest power of two
    and the result will be used as the first mipmap. *)
